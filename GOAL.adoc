= GOAL for gradle-about-plugin

Develop:
1. Java library
2. Gradle plugin

that are able to parse ABOUT files according to specification
(except when ABOUT specification contradicts YAML specification).

Library should be plain Java (no Groovy).

Gradle plugin should also be able to run:
1. `about check`
2. `about attrib`

= NOT GOALS
1. Java library might not be able to run full validation of ABOUT file
(run of `about check` does that).
2. Saving (serialization) of ABOUT files
3. Keep order of fields
4. Read text files referenced from ABOUT file (or even assert that they exist)
